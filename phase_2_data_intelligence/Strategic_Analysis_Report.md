- **Evening Commute (6-7 PM):** Secondary peak of 250+ ppb, indicating sustained traffic impact
- **Weekend Effect:** Pollution levels drop 59% on weekends (NOx: 255→160), demonstrating clear human activity correlation

**Long-term Trend Analysis:**
- **NOx Trends:** Summer 2004 (below 100) → Winter 2004-2005 (400-500 peak) → Spring 2005 decline
- **CO Trends:** Summer 2004 (1.5-2.0) → Winter 2004-2005 (2.5-3.0 peak) → Spring 2005 decline  
- **Benzene Trends:** Summer 2004 (5-10) → Winter 2004-2005 (15-18 peak) → Spring 2005 decline

## Modeling Strategy: Predictive Analytics Foundation

### Feature Engineering Strategy Based on Analytical Findings

#### 1. Temporal Feature Engineering
**Cyclical Encoding Implementation:**
```python
# Hour of day encoding (captures daily patterns)
df['hour_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)
df['hour_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['hour'] / 24)

# Day of week encoding (captures weekly patterns)
df['day_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['day_of_week'] / 7)
df['day_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['day_of_week'] / 7)

# Seasonal encoding (captures annual patterns)
df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month'] / 12)
```

**Rationale:** Cyclical encoding preserves the temporal relationships identified in our analysis, enabling models to learn the natural rhythms of air quality patterns.
